\section{Goals}
We plan to implement a file synchronization system based on \href{http://swtch.com/tra/}{Tra}. We plan to ensure that we achieve all the five objectives mentioned in the introduction of Tra Technical Report \cite{tra-tech-report}. We will implement multiple versions starting from a basic version that just ensures correctness (including Tra's ``no false conflicts'' guarantee) and optimize further for reduced network communication, and reduced metadata overhead. We plan to test it on up to 10 machines (or virtual machines, maybe on EC2) running concurrent updates to file systems.
