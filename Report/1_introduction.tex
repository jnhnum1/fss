\section {Introduction}
We implement a Tra based file system synchronization system. Our implementation, by design, ensures all the desirable properties mentioned in the introduction of Tra, i.e. no restriction on synchronization patterns, no false conflicts, no metadata for deleted files, network usage proportional to changed files and partial synchronizations within the file tree.
