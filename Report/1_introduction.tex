\section {Introduction}
We build a peer-to-peer file-system synchronizer, based on \href{http://swtch.com/tra/}{Tra}, which is performant and resilient to system crashes. Similar to Tra, TnT stores vector-time pairs for each file and directory.  With these, TnT ensures all the desirable properties mentioned in the introduction of Tra, i.e. no restriction on synchronization patterns, no false conflicts, no metadata for deleted files, network usage proportional to changed files and partial synchronizations within the file tree. We implement our file-system synchronizer in Go and ensure that all the guarantees for a file synchronizer mentioned in Tra are satisfied. We handle the system going offline by storing the metadata on the disk and using a two-phase synchronization method to ensure that crashes do not effect the system adversely even if they happen during sync.  We robustly test TnT's correctness across 5 machines making 1000 synchronizations across machines. Our results show that TnT successfully synchronizes across 5 machines.
