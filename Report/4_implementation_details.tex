\section{Implementation Details}
We will use Go for our implementation because of its good support for OS-level operations like watching the file system, high-level programming features, as well as our experience using Go in 6.824.\\

\noindent We will iteratively improve our file synchronization system, starting with a minimum viable implementation.  In particular, for our first iteration we will only try to achieve correctness using essentially the same techniques (the Vector Time pair algorithm) as in the Tra, but we will not implement any nonessential optimizations.\\

\noindent If we have more time, we will add the optimizations described in \cite{tra-tech-report}.
