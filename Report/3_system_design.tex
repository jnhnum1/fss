\section{System Design}

\subsection{File Watcher}
TnT has a method that allows the system to recognize when a user edits the directory.  In order to track the updates made by the user, TnT watches
the directory in the background using a Linux package called Inotify.  TnT initially sets a watch on the desired directory from Inotify.  When a 
user updates the file system in any way, they generate an event which is seen by the watcher.
